            list of important unsolved problems in science</h2>
            <p>From my brief stay at an academic institution as a
            doctoral student, I recall that many great scientific
            problems are unsuited for funding, and consequently, of any
            serious attention. The reasons vary:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>Some problems are too theoretical, with no practical
            application;</p></li>
            <li><p>or too difficult, unlikely to succeed, and reporting
            failure will not get another round of funding;</p></li>
            <li><p>or if some ‘solution’ exists already, maybe as an
            overly optimistic report to fake success on a failed
            project;</p></li>
            <li><p>or otherwise the presence of an old, often sketchy
            theory that should have been discarded long ago, but now it
            is difficult to explain to sponsors why to research a
            question for which we already has an answer.</p></li>
            <li><p>Also, researchers are expected to be humble and
            modest, no one likes a young guy who would want to tackle
            the ‘big’ problems in science.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>So here is my list of top-ten-or-twenty-something
            scientific problems, on whic I would fund research if I were
            a billionaire:</p>
            <h3 id="evolution-and-abiogenesis">Evolution and
            abiogenesis</h3>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><p><a
            href="Cosmic-scale-evolution/Planetary-sampling.html">Evolution</a>:
            while natural selection is obviously in play, some features
            are too complex to be developed gradually. Also, incomplete
            version of these features don’t carry any survival benefits,
            so selection cannot explain their appearance.</p></li>
            <li><p>Speciation: why species are so stable? If mutations
            and genetic drifting is the primary way of evolution, why
            don’t we see a spectrum of different animals, each diverging
            from its ancestors a little, exploring the fitness
            landscape?</p></li>
            <li><p>The problem of Extinction: it seems that some species
            survive despite obvious weaknesses. Eg thorny and toxic
            plants have a huge survival advantage over ‘edible’ plants,
            yet common grass is still prevalent. Where is natural
            selection?</p>
            <p>Somehow extinction is random, and it is triggered by some
            ‘internal’ mechanism: all species go extinct after some
            100-200 million years.</p></li>
            <li><p>The problem of abiogenesis: how life arose on Earth
            almost instantly after oceans formed, as LUCA (the Last
            Universal Common Ancestor) already contained the fully
            developed transcriptional / translational
            machinary?</p></li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="theory-of-mind">Theory of Mind</h3>
            <ol start="5" type="1">
            <li><p>Given a neural network, trained with backpropagation
            and/or reinforcement learning, what is a formalism that
            would describe the resulting internal representation? I want
            a formalism that is invariant to the specific random
            end-state of the learning, that is, the actual weight
            matric, but reveals the invariant structure that
            specifically represent a given input.</p></li>
            <li><p>This is related to the general question if the human
            mind is amenable to understanding with scientific concepts,
            that is if it has <em>modular structure</em>. Or it has <a
            href="Unstructured-complexity.html"><em>unstructured
            complexity</em></a> that cannot be dissected and
            comprehended by analytical thinking.</p></li>
