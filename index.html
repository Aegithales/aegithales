            id="my-list-of-important-unsolved-problems-in-science">My
            list of important unsolved problems in science</h2>
            <p>I always found that the <a
            href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/">Millenium
            Prize Problems</a> underwhelming. I know, I know, these are
            problems in mathematics, not in science in general, - but
            they are more like unsolved remnants of some already
            explored theories than actual hot problems that we need to
            answer to understand our true nature or origin as human
            beings.</p>
            <p>So here is my list of ten or twenty-something unsolved
            scientific problems that I find important and profound:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><p>Abiogenesis: how life arose on Earth almost instantly
            after oceans formed, as <a
            href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-024-02461-1">LUCA</a>
            (the Last Universal Common Ancestor) already contained the
            fully developed transcriptional / translational
            machinery?</p></li>
            <li><p>Evolution: why species are so stable? If mutations
            and genetic drifting is the primary way of evolution, why
            don’t we see a spectrum of different animals, each diverging
            from its ancestors a little, exploring the fitness
            landscape?</p></li>
            <li><p>Morphogenesis: how can be the process of development
            of adult form is so unerring, so accurate, unaffected by
            noise, not accumulating errors, even though it has no
            feedback on the shapes and size of organs and
            limbs?</p></li>
            <li><p>How instintive behaviours are encoded in the genome?
            For example, spiders don’t learn how to weave orb webs, they
            just know it…</p></li>
            <li><p>Perception is the process that incrementally build /
            maintain an <em>internal representation</em> of our
            surroundings, by processing sensory (mostly visual)
            input.</p>
            <p>What is the neural architecture that is capable to
            integrate, not only the visuals, but also <em>prior
            knowledge</em> of familiar objects, persons, and locations
            into this representation?</p></li>
            <li><p>I understand how classes of entities are recognized
            by networks of neurons, and how these classifiers are
            trained from data.</p>
            <p>But how the instances of these classes are learned, often
            from a single encounter?</p>
            <p>For example, the notion of a dog or a cat corresponds to
            a spot or a cluster of spots in ‘feature space’.</p>
            <p>But how the knowledge of a specific dog or cat is stored?
            It is unlikely that a classifier is trained for each
            <em>instance</em> of objects, animals, etc in our brain, yet
            we easily remember thousands of such instances.</p></li>
