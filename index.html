            <h2 id="welcome-to-my-website">Welcome to my website!</h2>
            <p>I publish here my theories which are utterly
            unpublishable otherwise, for reasons that should be obvious,
            if you check them out.</p>
            <h3 id="evolution-and-abiogenesis">Evolution and
            abiogenesis</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><p>While mutations, drifts, and natural selections are
            important mechanisms of evolution, especially on
            side-branches (not leading to humans), I think they cannot
            fully explain the huge jumps in evolution, introducing
            highly adaptive features.</p></li>
            <li><p>So I propose a new underlying mechanism for evolution
            and speciation, based on extremely ‘lucky’ series of
            mutations in the non-coding DNA. Even though the probability
            of accumulating these very precise mutations is practically
            zero, they will occur somewhere in the infinite
            universe.</p></li>
            <li><p>As we can only observe planets where intelligent life
            has developed, we are bound to see these extremely unlikely
            ‘jumps’ between species, at least on the ‘main
            branch’.</p></li>
            <li><p>Abiogenesis has a similar explanation: the first
            cells might have been formed by random synthesis of all the
            needed DNA, RNA, and proteins, over mineral surfaces as
            catalysts.</p>
            <p>So LUCA may have been developed in a single, unlikely
            step, without any evolution, or going through stages like
            the RNA world.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="theory-of-the-human-and-animal-brain">Theory of the
            human (and animal) brain</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><p>My goal here is to describe biologically realistic
            building blocks, that can be combined in well-defined ways
            to create realistic behaviours, and replicate human and
            animal cognition, intent, and emotions.</p></li>
            <li><p>Backpropagation is out of question, and so is some
            other AI techniques like convolutional NNs.</p></li>
            <li><p>I use two building blocks, both based on STDP
            (Spike-timing dependent placticity, a better version of
            Hebbian learning).</p></li>
