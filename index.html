            id="my-list-of-important-unsolved-problems-in-science">My
            list of important unsolved problems in science</h2>
            <p>I always found that the <a
            href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/">Millenium
            Prize Problems</a> underwhelming. I know, I know, these are
            problems in mathematics, not in science in general, - but
            they are more like unsolved remnants of some already
            explored theories than actual hot problems that we need to
            answer to understand our true nature or origin as human
            beings.</p>
            <p>So here is my list of ten or twenty-something unsolved
            scientific problems that I find important and profound:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li><p>Abiogenesis: how life arose on Earth almost instantly
            after oceans formed, as <a
            href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-024-02461-1">LUCA</a>
            (the Last Universal Common Ancestor) already contained the
            fully developed transcriptional / translational
            machinery?</p></li>
            <li><p>Evolution: why species are so stable? If mutations
            and genetic drifting is the primary way of evolution,
            achieving <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence"><em>swarm
            intelligence</em></a> why don’t we see that ‘swarm’ of
            variants, each diverging from its ancestors a little,
            exploring the fitness landscape?</p></li>
            <li><p>True infinity of the cosmos (in space): is there a
            way to prove it? Does it have observable effects? Hint: it
            does…</p></li>
            <li><p>The side-branch complexity problem: while
            probabilities, leading to intelligent beings, are amplified
            to 1 by the ‘anthropic’ principle, why do we see probability
            amplification on the side-branches, not needed for
            humans?</p></li>
            <li><p>Morphogenesis: how can be the development of adult
            form so unerring, so accurate, unaffected by noise, not
            accumulating errors, even though it has no feedback on the
            shape and size and structure of organs and limbs?</p></li>
            <li><p>How instintive behaviours are encoded in the genome?
            For example, spiders don’t learn how to weave orb webs, they
            just know it…</p></li>
            <li><p>Perception is the process that incrementally build /
            maintain an <em>internal representation</em> of our
            surroundings, by processing sensory (mostly visual)
            input.</p>
            <p>What is the neural architecture that is capable to
            integrate, not only the visuals, but also <em>prior
            knowledge</em> of familiar objects, persons, and locations
            into this representation?</p></li>
            <li><p>I understand how classes of entities are recognized
            by networks of neurons, and how these classifiers are
            trained from data.</p>
            <p>But how the instances of these classes are learned, often
            from a single encounter?</p>
            <p>For example, the notion of a dog or a cat corresponds to
            a spot or a cluster of spots in ‘feature space’.</p>
            <p>But how the knowledge of a specific dog or cat is stored?
            It is unlikely that a classifier is trained for each
            <em>instance</em> of objects, animals, etc in our brain, yet
            we easily remember thousands of such instances.</p></li>
            <li><p>Intent: how intent is formed? How is it combined with
            perception to select and control the action?</p>
            <p>How innate goals / desires (like mating, survival, etc)
            restrict or give rise to intent and actions?</p></li>
            <li><p>A generic framework to describe neural architectures,
            allowing to create ‘blueprints’ of the brain, and prove or
            disprove statements (‘theorems’) about it.</p>
            <p>The framework should be agnostic of the underlying neuron
            models (spiking, McCulloch–Pitts / MCP, …), or the actual
            neural encoding…</p></li>
            <li><p>What is the architecture / model component (in this
            putative framework) that allows <em>rehearsal</em> of
            actions in the mind?</p>
            <p>How we imagine storylines, enjoy novels, daydream, or
            recall events, recreating perception states, without sensory
            input?</p></li>
            <li><p>How sleeping and dreaming can be modeled in this
            framework?</p></li>
            <li><p>How mental disorders, like depression, psychosis, etc
            can be modeled?</p>
            <p>How can we model neurodevelopmental disorders, like
            intellectual disability, motor disorders, etc?</p></li>
            <li><p>Besides brain / CNS substructures, the framework
            should allow the description / modeling of putative implants
            in the brain.</p>
            <p>Then we may ask the grand question if it is possible to
            ‘fix’ some mental disorders through implants,</p></li>
            <li><p>or even if some part of semantic / episodic memory,
            being transferred into the implants, which would act like a
            cortical area.</p></li>
            <li><p>Would it be possible for a brain implant to gradually
            take over large areas of the cortex, and ultimately,
            transfer consciousness into the chip, seemlessly, in a
            waking state?</p></li>
            <li><p>Would a chip like this allow the transfer of the
            patient’s consciousness into a computer system, maintaining
            this consciousness beyond the death of the patient’s
            body?</p></li>
