            <blockquote>
            <p>“we make our world significant by the courage of our
            questions and the depth of our answers” ― Carl Sagan,
            Cosmos</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>One striking way to contrast the popular imagination of
            how evolution works with reality is by examining
            bio-inspired evolutionary algorithms. These blind search
            processes generate a wide variety of potential designs —
            often by combining features from earlier candidates — and
            then evaluate or test them extensively, maintaining a
            diverse pool of alternatives throughout.</p>
            <p>This bears little resemblance to actual biological
            evolution, where species tend to be remarkably stable, often
            persisting for over 100 million years. There isn’t a fuzzy
            blob of slightly varied “candidates” being tested for
            survival. Instead, speciation appears to be a relatively
            sudden event when viewed against the vast timescale of the
            fossil record.</p>
            <p>To <em>search</em> for optimal, nontrivial design we need
            to explore a huge number of alternative
            <em>concurrently</em>. The Darwinian theory assumes that
            this concurrent, parallel search happens here, on Earth, in
            the form of mutated individuals that fail to survive. But
            even if we can sometimes find an example for adaptive
            mutations, they are the exceptions, and so few that they
            cannot make up the <em>bulk</em> of the huge number of
            failure that a real search would produce.</p>
            <p>On these pages, I would like to explore that idea that
            evolution happens concurrently on an infinite number of
            Earth-like planets, scattered around the infinite space of
            the Universe. In most cases, evolution (and even
            abiogenesis) fails on these planets, but given the actual
            infinity of space, there are some where extremely unlikely
            events conicide and accumulate, creating life and
            ultimately, intelligent beings.</p>
            <p>Naturally, we can observe only one of these planets,
            where evolution succeeded, and we don’t see all the others
            where it failed. This is called <em>anthropic
            selection</em>. So the blind search by mutational events
            does occur concurrently on infinite number of planets, but
            we never get to see the complete ‘fuzzy blob’ of
            alternatives, most of which occur on extremely remote
            galaxies.</p>
