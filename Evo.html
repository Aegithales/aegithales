            <p>Panspermia is an old idea that life arrived on earth from
            outer space, by a meteor, landing in the oceans, carrying
            some bacteria or other ancient life form.</p>
            <p>This theory relieves the extremely tight time constraint
            that otherwise would be given for DNA-based life forms to
            develop on Earth, after the formation of Oceans - which is
            estimated like 200-400 million years.</p>
            <p>But I would propose another way how abiogenesis could
            occur in the vast universe, and appear on Earth as a result
            of trial-and-error on billions of other planets: I believe
            that abiogenesis and evolution is actually occurring
            concurrently on an infinite number of earth-like planets,
            failing on most of them, - but we can observe it only on
            those planets where intelligent life forms, like humans have
            developed.</p>
            <p>This is the Table of Contents for my theory:</p>
            <ul>
            <li><p>The actual <a href="thesis/Infinite-space.html">shape
            and size of the Universe</a> is not well understood by
            laymen, and many people think that the universe is
            boundless, but finite, like a 4-dimensional sphere. And
            indeed, this is a valid solution of Einstein’s field
            equation.</p>
            <p>But a completely flat, infinite space is also a solution,
            and recent experimental data on microwave background
            radiaton supports this notion.</p>
            <p>Which means there are infinitely many galaxies, like
            ours, in the universe, and infinitely many Earth-like
            planets.</p>
            <p>This notion changes everything for evolution and
            abiogenesis.</p></li>
            <li><p>By way do we need a theory? What’s wrong with the
            current theory? <a
            href="thesis/Blind-search-by-random-mutations.html">It is
            the idea of blind search</a>, driven by ‘survival of the
            fittest’, or ‘natural selection’, which might not have the
            <em>computational power</em> to produce some of the
            complexities that we observe.</p></li>
