            <h2 id="unstructured-complexity">Unstructured
            Complexity</h2>
            <ul>
            <li><p>There are many measures of complexity: Kolmogorov
            complexity, computational complexity, Krohn–Rhodes
            complexity, Linguistic sequence complexity, etc.</p></li>
            <li><p>But I want a complexity measure that reflects our
            ability to explain / comprehend something with human
            cognition, using our capacity to represent / explain a
            system / phenomenon by combining well-understood building
            blocks.</p></li>
            <li><p>Eg well-written software has an easy-to-understand
            structure, composed of modules with well-defined API and
            purpose.</p></li>
            <li><p>But some natural systems might lack this modular
            structure, bearing a complexity that is impenetrable for the
            human mind, like</p>
            <ul>
            <li>embryonic development;</li>
            <li>metamorphosis of insects;</li>
            <li>how instinctive behaviour is encoded in the genome and
            the CNS of animals;</li>
            <li>evolution of some highly complex traits;</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li><p>Note that this is not about size. A system may be
            huge, and still easy to understand. It is about structure or
            the lack of it.</p></li>
            <li><p>My first attempt is what I call <em>diagrammatic
            complexity</em>: a ‘diagram’ is a graph of nodes that are
            interconnected by labeled edges.</p>
            <p>A ‘node’ may stand for a subgraph, which is then
            presented on another diagram.</p>
            <p>Decomposing the full diagram into smaller diagrams is
            only possible if the diagram has some regularity /
            structure.</p>
            <p>The complexity is the size the of the largest diagram
            after the decomposition.</p></li>
            <li><p>Back to our examples: a well-written software is
            obviously decomposable into smaller ‘diagrams’, like
            classes, functions, etc. that are re-used.</p>
            <p>But the genomic features, controlling development or
            metamorphosis, may lack such a modular structure.</p>
            <p>Which means we might be completely unable to understand
            it.</p></li>
            <li><p>I hope that some important systems are still within
            the bounds of structured complexity, amenable for human
            cognition:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>our brain and our mind itself;</li>
            <li>and the system of tissues / organs of the adult human
            body (as a static system, excluding development).</li>
            </ul></li>
            </ul>
