            <h2 id="planetary-sampling-by-space-travel">Planetary
            sampling by space travel</h2>
            <p>Imagine an explorer, trying to find out the probability
            of life on an ‘earth-like planet’ (ELP). She has access to
            unlimited space travel, able to ‘teleport’ to any remote
            galaxies instantaneously.</p>
            <p>Her method is sampling the planets randomly, and checking
            for signs of carbon-based life. After visiting a large
            number of planets, let’s say
            <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msub><mi>N</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">N_{total}</annotation></semantics></math>,
            she can derive the <em>transitional probability</em> of
            abiogenesis, as
            <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mi>R</mi><mi>P</mi><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>N</mi><mrow><mi>l</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>e</mi></mrow></msub><mi>/</mi><msub><mi>N</mi><mrow><mi>t</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>t</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>l</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">TRP = N_{life} / N_{total}</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>
            <p>This method is theoretically perfect, but has many flaws
            <em>in practice</em>. If the transitional probability from
            barren to life is very low, there is a chance that our
            researcher will not find any life form, even after visiting
            a million planets. So she will conclude that
            <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mi>R</mi><mi>P</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">TRP = 0</annotation></semantics></math>,
            even if it is obviously not the case.</p>
            <p>Also, assuming the space travel has a range limit, she
            will mostly explore the galaxies in vicinity of her home
            planet, which is a non-uniform sampling, resulting in a
            biased estimation.</p>
            <p>But what is really crazy, is that this bias remains even
            if we remove the range constraint of teleportation. It is
            enough that the explorer has to choose her destination: - it
            will always be in the ‘vicinity’ or her home planet, when
            considering the vastness of an infinite universe.</p>
            <p>If you doubt it, consider the analogous problem of
            selecting a random postitive integer. We are inclined to
            select a ‘small’ one, even though 99.999% of the positive
            integers have more than one billion digits. Actually, there
            is no way to even define a <em>uniform</em> probability
            distribution over the positive integers.</p>
            <p>If the universe in infinite in space, as it is now the
            most probable cosmological model, then <em>planetary
            sampling</em> by space travel will never be an unbiased,
            uniform sampling.</p>
            <h2 id="planetary-sampling-by-reincarnation">Planetary
            sampling by reincarnation</h2>
            <p>Now stretching our thought experiment even further, let’s
            assume that instead of space travel, the researcher explores
            the universe by <em>reincarnating</em> on different planets
            in each of her lives.</p>
            <p>Being born on a certain planet has no range limit, so
            this is a spatially uniform sampling of an infinite
            Universe.</p>
            <p>One can object that reincarnation is a fictional concept,
            but we may counter that every human being is born at least
            once. Even if that is not reincarnation, it is a way of
            <em>planetary sampling</em>, selecting an earth-like planet
            randomly in an infinite universe.</p>
            <p>Admittedly, the sample size (1) is very small, yet it can
            yield a crude estimation of the
            <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mi>R</mi><mi>P</mi><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mi>b</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>l</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>e</mi><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">TRP(barren \rightarrow life)</annotation></semantics></math>.</p>
            <p>But now we are facing another kind of bias: anthropic
            selection. Obviously humans always reincarnates on planets
            with life, so our researcher will always find that her home
            planet has highly evolved life forms, and even intelligent
            life (herself).</p>
            <h2 id="planetary-sampling-of-strange-life-forms">Planetary
            sampling of strange life-forms</h2>
            <p>So sampling planets for abiogenesis (or even intelligent
            life form) is biased by <em>anthropic selection</em>.</p>
            <p>How about sampling planets to check if a certain
            life-form has developed on that planet? A life-form that is
            not ‘needed’ as an intermediate species to eventually evolve
            humans?</p>
            <p>Let’s take, for example, a curious fish species, the
            Stargazer fish. It is highly adapted to its special way to
            lure its prey near to its mouth and stun it with an
            electrical shock, while burying itself into the ocean
            floor:</p>

            <video width="320" height="240" loop controls autoplay muted>
            <source src="../video/Stargazer-fish.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Your browser does not support the video tag. </video>
            </center>
            <p>We can say that the Stargazer fish, evolving on a certain
            planet, is an independent event from the appearance of
            intelligent life, so <em>anthropic selection</em> does not
            bias this observation.</p>
            <p>One would expect that only the minimally required other
            life forms (bacteria, plants, etc) would be observed by our
            reincarnated researcher, as these exotic, strange life forms
            have very low TRPs, so an unbiased <em>planetary
            sampling</em> would not find them at all.</p>
            <p>But strangely, our planet Earth is abound of these exotic
            creatures on evolutionary side-branches (not on the main
            branch, leading to humans). Why don’t we observe a lean,
            frugal evolutionary tree, with only a few ‘other’
            species?</p>
            <p>Again, there is a subtle sampling bias here. I have
            chosen the Stargazer fish, as an ‘exotic’ animal, - but I
            did not choose it randomly. I knew about it, I was
            fascinated by this fish, so in a way, I chose to test the
            existence of a species that I knew it was present on
            Earth.</p>
            <h2
            id="planetary-sampling-of-the-shape-of-the-tree-of-life">Planetary
            sampling of the shape of the Tree of Life</h2>
            <p>Ok, forget about the Stargazer fish. Let’s sample planets
            with intelligent life, and check if the Tree of Life is a
            long stalk with very few branches, ending in the Homo
            Sapiens node, or a large tree spreading laterally, with many
            side branches.</p>
            <p>It seems that a large, bushy tree would be less probable,
            as each point of branching adds a factor of the transitional
            probability of that branching, which is small. So less
            branching, higher probability…</p>
            <p>Maybe, but do we sample properly the total probability of
            observing a tree of a certain shape, by the assumed
            probabilities of each branching events?</p>
            <p>To illustrate the bias in this computation, let’s have a
            look at the long, barren tree with as few side branches as
            possible: we assume it has the highest probability. But we
            did not count in the probability of <em>not branching</em>
            at any point in time: which is a big product of factors like
            <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><mi>T</mi><mi>R</mi><msub><mi>P</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(1 - TRP_i)</annotation></semantics></math>
            for each transitional events
            <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>i</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i</annotation></semantics></math>
            that did not happen. If there are lots of such events, the
            product is close to zero, lowering the total probability of
            the long, slim tree.</p>
